## Carly Jenkinson

After five years of working as an Administrative assistant carrying out various tasks, I craved for a challenge. Once I discovered programming I knew I had found what I had been looking for - now I could exercise my problem solving abilities.

Ideally I would like to work as a full-stack developer because I want to develop a thorough understanding of the impact my actions have so that I can make informed decisions. I would like to grow my skill-set around talented like-minded people (curious, craving challenges, determined, resourceful, creative, asking the right questions/not afraid to ask questions, friendly, quality-driven). I would like to work in a friendly, supportive, nurturing environment which applies test-driven development and agile methodologies. I am interested in web and mobile development.
