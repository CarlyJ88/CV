# Carly Jenkinson

I am driven towards a career as a Software Engineer by a thirst for creativity, a passion for learning, and a need to use my critical thinking skills to solve problems. My previous role as an Administrative Assistant allowed me to exercise my attention to detail and communication skills, which I can bring with me in my new role as a Software Engineer. I discovered Makers Academy which gave me a place to practice my skills and get an idea of what it means to be a developer, and now I am ready to begin my new career.

## Projects

|[Tastybot](https://github.com/CarlyJ88/TastyBot)| My personal project since finishing Makers. With Tastybot, I aim to expand on the previous project with my own unique touch. One goal is to set the application up so the user can keep track of all their ingredients and once they select and use a recipe this will remove the specified quantity in the ingredients for each item from the same ingredients listed in the current stock. I am currently making the backend layer in Ruby on Rails then I will create the front end in React. Later I want deploy this application to my android phone using React Native. | Ongoing | Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL | RSpec, Capybara, Travis CI, Docker, Heroku|
|[Dinnergy](https://github.com/jordantroberts/dinnergy)| My final project at Makers, with a team of six, we set out to build our first mobile app which is a completely new domain and tech stack.

## Skills

### Attention to detail

My previous role required a high level of accuracy across the various workflows I undertook from validating potential student's identity and residency status to ensuring invoices are paid to suppliers in full and the evidence of this payment being due was satisfactory. 
- Dealing with large quantities of customer data in a compliant manner.
- Ensuring data entered is accurate (maintain over 98% accuracy level).
- Keeping up-to-date with changes to work instructions and policy

### Communication

Communication was a huge part of my role as an Administrative Assistant, on a daily basis I needed to liaise with students, countersignatures, my colleagues, managers and suppliers whether it was via email or over the phone. As I represented the company the way I communicated was crucial to the success of my daily tasks. I undertook some communication training on how to communicate effectively over the telephone, including some training on how to deal with difficult customers. I took this on board and it really helped me be successful in some difficult situations.

### Time management

In my previous role my productivity was measured on a daily basis so I needed to remain focused and be efficient when changing between tasks while maintaining a high level of accuracy.

## Experience

**Student Loans Company** (25/03/2013 - 31/10/2018)    
*Administrative Assistant*

As an Administration Assistant I became an expert in the handling of the pre-processing of student loans applications within the Student Loans Company. My main responsibilities were manual processing and data entry of various evidence types such as Passport, Identity cards and Birth Certificate data entry, coupled with proof of residency. Other responsibilities I handled was in the area of customer invoicing and supplier relations where I ensured the quality of payments to customers, and the assurance from our external suppliers.

I was nominated by my team to be the 'Voice' leader. This was a particularly challenging role as it stretched my capabilities and ensured I learned many transferable skills to develop my inter- and intra-team relationships.

During this time I became familiar with the Microsoft Office suite, including Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. I also developed strong verbal and written communication as this was the main driver of any customer contact.
